# Autonomous Driving Simulation Platform
Remote solution for physical STEM competition in COVID

## Task
Build a platform that allows for real-time simulation of cars in the High School Autonomous Vehicle Competition. ([HSAVC](https://www.rose-hulman.edu/academics/educational-outreach/autonomous-vehicle-challenge/index.html))

## Criteria
* Fast, real-time simulation.
* Up to 90% simulation motion accuracy compared to real life camera footage.
* Accessible, simple UI for using the simulator.

## How to use it?
Download this repository as a ZIP file onto your computer.
Extract the file.
Install MATLAB if you haven't already, and run MATLAB.
Under the apps section in MATLAB, press the "Install App" icon, and select "Track-Generator.mlappinstall" and "Simulator.mlappinstall" from the extracted compressed file when prompted.
#TODO NEED TO EXPLAIN HOW TO USE THE ACTUAL APPS
