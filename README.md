Remote solution for physical STEM competition in COVID

Rose-Hulman University hosts the High School Autonomous Vehicle Competition, a contest for high school students to learn camera-based autonomous driving on random and set tracks. Due to COVID-19, a physical competition is becoming increasingly difficult as many students stay remote and travel is limited. 
At Eleanor Roosevelt High School, we are developing a simulator that allows for the same STEM activity, with the same MATLAB and Simulink challenges, without the physical interaction aspect.

STATUS 11/24/2020: Finished: Working version of each component. TODO: Put pieces together, create working simulator block.
